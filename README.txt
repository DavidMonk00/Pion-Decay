Despite the large number of modules, the only two that yield results are datagen.py and plot.py.

- If the plot function requires reading data from a file, the data must be generated first, using the Gen class within datagen.py.
- NOTE: No FTP methods will work without the password to the server and in order to protect my prviacy, this will not be distributed to demonstrators. The code will run fine locally, the FTP is simply there to collate data over multiple machines.
- My lab book was not used for this practical as all of my progress was tracked through GitHub. If you would like to see this progress, including obsolete branches from each day worked on the software, please refer to https://github.com/DavidMonk00/Pion-Decay
